\section{Undergraduate thesis}
\cvitem{title}{\emph{Modeling Cell Signaling Networks with Prize-Collecting Subhypernetworks}}
\cvitem{supervisors}{James D. Fix \& Anna M. Ritz}
\cvitem{description}{Developed the notion of a ``hypershrub," a multi-source, multi-target generalization of a hyperpath. Created a formulation that finds specific, prize-dense hypershrubs representative of biological phenomena, which was implemented in Python. Finally, applied this formulation to the human Hedgehog signaling pathway, related to Basal Cell carcinoma, to analyze the effectiveness of the algorithm in real data.}

COVER LETTER BODY
ADDING CHANGES FOR DEBUGGING\\
%
%
% My name is Barney Potter and I am a recent graduate of Reed College in Portland, Oregon. I majored in both mathematics and biology. I have a very strong background in computational biology and computer science and a passion for designing algorithms to tackle problems in computational sciences.
%
% I was searching the Fred Hutch labs recently, and I noticed you as someone I should contact regarding my research interests. I find that your research interests in connecting computational methodologies with phylogenetics  and genomics is in-line with my own personal research interests.
%
% Personally, I am interested in building efficient algorithms and models that can help contribute to advancing biological knowledge and human health. I recently finishedwriting my senior undergraduate thesis where I built a generalization of Prize-Collecting Steiner Trees, which I used to find dysregulated pathways in cancer tissues based on differential gene expression. I have experience working in transcriptomics (studying polyploidy in Arabidopsis thaliana), computer science and computational biology, and designing and implementing algorithms for use in biological systems.
%
% I hope to attend graduate school, but am planning to take time off. I believe that your work would be an invaluable bridge between my interests in computational biology and that of human health during my gap years. I would appreciate the opportunity to be a contributing team member as a research associate, bringing my best efforts and unique skill set to your work.
%
% I know that you are very busy at this time but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time to discuss potential opportunities in the future.
